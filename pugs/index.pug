                section
                    h2 Why did I make this website?
                    p
                        | The main motivation behind creating this website, was to learn web development. I use this
                        | website to learn HTML, CSS, javascript and more.
                        br
                        | However while working on this website and thinking about the content to place here, I quickly
                        | realized that it would be a good idea, opportunity and motivation to use this website as a
                        | place to house the documentation for all my personal projects.
                        | This will thus be the main purpose of this website, to provide the documentation for my
                        | personal projects, along with the files hosted on GitHub. A short description of my projects,
                        | along with a link to the relevant page, can be found on the
                        a(href="projects.html")  projects
                        |  page.
                    p
                        | The website for each project will be housed in the <var>docs</var> folder in the
                        | project repository on GitHub. However I hope to keep the design the same across these
                        | different websites and repositories, in order to keep the transition from one site to another
                        | as smooth as possible. Perhaps even hiding the transition.
